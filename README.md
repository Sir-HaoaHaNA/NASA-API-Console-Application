# NASA-API-Console-Application
This application is a Python-based console application that allows users to retrieve and display various types of space-related data from the NASA API. Users can choose from multiple endpoints such as Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), Mars Rover Photos, Near-Earth Objects (NEO), Earth imagery, Satellite Situation Center, EONET, and DONKI. They can then save this pulled data to local .txt files, that the program will make, and can also view these saved files in the program.
